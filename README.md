1. List of transactions for the current day. Format - CSV.  
2. List of terminals. Format - XLSX.

Information about cards, accounts, and customers is stored in the Oracle DBMS in the BANK schema.  
You are provided with an upload for the last three days, it must be processed.  

    
The data must be loaded into storage with the specified structure.
